                   <h2 class="happyhour">Cafe Trio</h2>
                   <p id="whatilike">Cafe Trio's all day happy hour on Monday's is the cure to a classic case of the Mondays! Located on the Country Club Plaza, with their patio overlooking the famous J.C.Nichols Fountain, makes this restaurant one of Kansas City's best date spots as well. So bring a date, or just a friend, and #MartiniMondays at Cafe Trio. They're open from 11am-9pm with the bar usually staying open one hour after the kitchen closes. My favorites on their happy hour include $3 Boulevard Brewing drafts, $5 Dirty Martini (don't forget to ask for bleu cheese stuffed olives), Tuscan Shrimp flatbread, Truffle fries, and their famous Mac Daddy! If you can't make it on Monday, no problem, they have happy hour 2-6pm Tuesday-Friday as well.

                   <h2 class="happyhour">Waldo Thai</h2>
                   <p id="whatilike">Finally! Great thai food in Waldo! Waldo Thai is a little bit of a hidden gem. Tucked away in an unassuming strip mall on the corner of 85th and Wornall, you could dribe by this wonderful eatery and never know what you were missing. On the bar side, Tuesday - Sunday, 3-6pm, Waldo Thai offers their happy hour menu. 11 classic cocktails done excellently, wine, beer and whiskey are all on special. But the happy hour food is what you don't want to miss. Snack and share some Giaw Grob Cheese (think crab rangoon) and Pla Meuk Gra Ta (fried calamari), and order their signature Phad Thai Gai for your meal. You'll be stuffed and still have money in your wallet. Waldo Thai also offers a reverse Happy Hour Tuesday-Saturday from 9pm-close.</p>

                   <h2 class="happyhour">Jax Fish House & Oyster Bar</h2>
                <p id="whatilike">This Happy Hour surpised me. I had no idea such a great seafood restaraunt located in the Country Club Plaza, would have such an affordable happy hour. What sets this happy hour apart from the others in the city are the OYSTERS! East coast raw oysters for $1.50/each or cooked oysters at $3.00/each. Feast on oysters and share a plate of Jax's amazing Tuna Poke Nachos on wonton style chips. Jax also offers a wide variety of cocktails, beer, and wine on their happy hour but unfortunately not including my favorite Portuguese Vinoh Verde. It's worth paying the full price for though to pair with your happy hour oysters. The slight effervensence of a glass of vinoh verde cleanses your palate and lifts the sea salt flavor of oysters right off your tongue. Making you want another sip and bite, over and over again. Try Jax Happy Hour all night Mondays, 4-6pm Tuesday-Friday, and 3-6pm on the weekends!</p>

                   <h2 class="happyhour">Charlie Hoopers Bar and Grille</h2>
                   <p id="whatilike">Charlie Hoopers has been the Brookside neighorhood's favorite watering hole since 1980. With a come as you are, at home cozy feel, the barstools are full of people of different ages, different places they're coming from, and different places they're going. But stick around long enough and you'll notice many of them know eachother and everyone knows the staff. Prices have been slowly increasing, and the happy hour specials have narrowed down a bit, but it remains a great place to go alone, with friends or famly, or even meet a casual online date. The best part of their happy hour, Monday-Friday 3-6pm, is the half price appetizers. ALL OF THEM! The Spicy Shrimp, Hummus, and Turbo Tots are my favorites. And although the happy hour drink specials aren't that special, Hooper's has daily specials that can  be combined with happy hour, making it all the more worth it. Monday's half price American whiskey's are the best deal, and Thursday's $2 off craft draft beers goes great with happy hour food.</p>

                   <h2 class="happyhour">Extra Virgin</h2>
                   <p id="whatilike">It's no secret in Kansas City, Extra Virgin has arguably the best Happy Hour in town. The only argument being it's offered for a shorter amount of time than others. With half off their full tapas and bar menu Monday-Friday 4-6pm. But you are getting absolutely excellent cocktails and small plates! And on Monday's they have a wood fired pizza special with no corkage fee on bottles of wine you bring from home. When you want to feel fancy but remain cheap, Extra Virgin, located in KC's popular Crossroads District, is the happy hour not to miss.</p>
